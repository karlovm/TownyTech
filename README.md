___

A plugin that adds additional town improvements to the Towny plugin. Three branches: hunters, farmers and miners, each of which can be pumped to get effects.

## 
## How it works
In the configuration file, you can configure the city levels and branch levels (when pumping, the difference in the level of branches should not be more than 1), as well as their price, for which the player will be able to pump up to them.
